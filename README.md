# Ray-Tracing
Following Ray Tracing in a Weekend as a bit of a practise exercise.
I'm adding a few of my own tweaks like multithreading and a built-in image viewer to make sure it's not just copy-pasting

## Dependencies
Uses SFML 2.5.1 to preview the image after it's generated

## Build
Load the project in Visual Studio and it should do most of the work for you
